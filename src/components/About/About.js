            I am a graduate of BrainStation's Full Stack Web Developer Program.
            I became a Web Developer because this practice allows me to inhabit
            the space where art and science collide. To me coding is like
            overhearing a conversation in a foreign language, or like catching
            music drifiting through fog. It's also the beauty and wonder of an
            industrial site - where scaffolding and a thousand tiny pieces come
            together to build something incredible.

            I am seeking projects to
            maximize the value I can bring to end-users in todayâ€™s digital
            world. I look forward to being continuously challenged and learning
            new things every day.

            Building state-of-the-art, easy to use, user-friendly websites and
            applications is truly a passion of mine. This industry appeals to me
            because it's beautiful and breathtaking and messy, yet also demands
            razor's-edge precision. It's some of the most rewarding and
            challenging work I've ever done, and I strive to showcase the best
            parts of myself in the work that I do.
